# Corpus preparation

TRACER works with plain text files \(`.txt`\). This means that if you have marked-up texts in XML, you must remove all of the XML tags before you can use TRACER.

To optimise the performance of TRACER, place your texts \(two or more, depending on how many you wish to analyse\) in the same `.txt` file, one under the other. Placing all texts in a single file is beneficial as TRACER will consider every line as a reuse unit to compare. To distinguish the texts, you will use different IDs \(keep reading to find out how to do this\).
