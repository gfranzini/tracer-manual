# Limitations

While very powerful and flexible, TRACER also has limitations.

## Garbage in, garbage out

The quality and accuracy of the results computer by TRACER depend on the quality of input data. If the corpus is dirty or if the linguistic resources \(lemma files, WordNets, etc.\) are suboptimal, the results of TRACER will be affected. So, the higher the quality of the input data, the better the TRACER results. 



## Visualisation of text reuse results

Another limitation of TRACER concerns the visualisation of the computed text reuse results. While adequate to display small data, TRAViz is not well-suited for visualising a large number of results \(e.g. comparing 10 texts against one another\). This is because the underlying code of TRAViz \(JavaScript\) is not able to process and load large amounts of information.
