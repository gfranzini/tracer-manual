# Recommendation: keeping a logbook

By now, the reader will have realised that multiple detection tasks are needed per work-pair in order to tease out as many text reuse styles from your texts as possible. To help keep track of these experiments, we recommend the creation of a logbook to record each and every task with the respective result-set. We find this helps to avoid duplicating analyses and more easily identify the optimal settings for a particular detection task. An example logbook might look something like this:
