# FAQ

## Q. How do I cite TRACER?

The first TRACER article in English is still under publication. Depending on your referencing style, you can adapt the following:

Büchler, M., Franzini, G., Franzini, E. Bulert, K. \(2018 forthcoming\) ‘TRACER - a multilevel framework for historical Text Reuse detection’, _Journal of Data Mining and Digital Humanities - Special Issue on Computer-Aided Processing of Intertextuality in Ancient Languages_.

## Q. Can I reuse TRACER’s code in my work?

Yes. As per TRACER’s Academic Free License \(see [Copyright](../manual/introduction/tracer-overview.md)\), you’re allowed to repurpose the source code as long as you credit the source, share your code in a similar fashion and don’t financially profit from it.

## Q. Where can I find information about future TRACER tutorials?

The [www.etrap.eu](https://github.com/gfranzini/tracer-manual/tree/fcf664a1bd71584352b193a070b981eb8b89f224/www.etrap.eu) website always lists upcoming tutorials a few weeks in advance. These are typically run during conferences or summer schools.
