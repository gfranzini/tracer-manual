# Windows: length of folder name

When running TRACER on a Windows machine, the length of the folder names generated by TRACER within `TRACER_DATA` after a detection task might break the text reuse visualization. This means that the `index.html` file in the TRAViz postprocessing folder, although correctly computed, will display a blank or an error page in the browser. To fix the issue, rename all folders nested in `TRACER_DATA` to something shorter \(e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\). Once all folders are renamed, the `index.html` file can be reopened and the text reuse visualization will load in the browser.
