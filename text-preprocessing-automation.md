# Text Preprocessing Automation

To improve the usability of TRACER, a script is being developed to **drastically simplify the text preparation process**.

The experimental development generates TRACER-compatible `.txt` and `.lemma` files from TreeTagger output, which means that the user does not have to prepare every text \(s\)he wants to analyse according to the 4-column TRACER format.



First, users run TreeTagger on the texts they wish to analyse. The output file of TreeTagger shoud have `.tagged` as a suffix, e.g.,: `author-title.tagged`
The preferred file-naming convention is `00-author-title_of_work.tagged`. The naming convention helps TRACER generate the `.txt` file to be used for the analysis (see below). If there are multiple works to analyse, the numbering of the files should be sequential (e.g., `01-`, `02-`, etc.); digits, author and title should be separated by hyphens, and any whitespace in the work title must be represented with an underscore.


Then, all `.tagged` files must be deposited in a tagged folder under TRACER's `/data/corpora/`directory, e.g.,: `/data/corpora/Bible/tagged/author-title.tagged`

Next, users now navigate to the main TRACER folder and type the following command: 

```
java -Xmx1g -Deu.etrap.medusa.config.ClassConfig=conf/tracer_config.xml -cp tracer.jar eu.etrap.tracer.preprocessing.external.lemmatisation.DeveloperTestClassLemmatisationMain
```

This command generates three files in the `/data/corpora/Bible/` folder: a `.txt` file containing all of the texts for TRACER to study \(already tokenised by sentence and sequentially ID'd\), a `.lemma-list` file containing all of the unique lemmas of all the texts under study, and a `.lemma` file containing all of the lemmas+pos tags of all texts under study.

Next, in the `tracer_config.xml` file, users add the paths to the `.txt` and `.lemma` files generated by TRACER.

Finally, users can now execute TRACER.
