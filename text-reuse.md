# Text reuse: What is it?

At its most basic level, text reuse is a form of written text repetition or borrowing. Text reuse can take the form of an allusion, a paraphrase or even a verbatim quotation, and occurs when one author borrows or reuses text from an earlier or contemporary author. The borrower, or _quoting_ author, may wish to reproduce the text of the _quoted_ author word-for-word or reformulate it completely.

The chart below illustrates the various _styles_ of text reuse we may encounter. Given two or more texts we wish to compare, there are two main branches of text reuse:

1. _**Syntactic text reuse**_, which includes verbatim and near-verbatim quotations, as well as idioms. This style of text reuse is "easier" for a machine to read and identify.
2. _**Semantic text reuse**_, which includes looser forms of reuse such as allusion, analogy and paraphrase. These are harder to detect with a machine as they operate at a more semantic level.

Text reuse detection on historical data is particularly challenging due to the fragmentary nature of the texts under investigation and the evolution of language over time.
