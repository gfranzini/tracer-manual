# Text reuse: What is it?

At its most basic level, text reuse is a form of written text repetition or borrowing. Text reuse can take the form of an allusion, a paraphrase or even a verbatim quotation, and occurs when one author borrows or reuses text from an earlier or contemporary author. The borrower, or _quoting_ author, may wish to reproduce the text of the _quoted_ author word-for-word or reformulate it completely. We call this form of borrowing “intentional" text reuse. “Unintentional" text reuse can be understood as an idiom or a winged word, whose origin is unknown and that has become part of common usage. Text reuse detection on historical data is particularly challenging due to the fragmentary nature of the texts under investigation and the evolution of language over time.
